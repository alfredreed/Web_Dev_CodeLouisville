# Web_Dev_CodeLouisville
repo for CodeLouisville project work
Site: ReedTech
Developer: Alfred Reed
Description: The site is used to showcase my skills in web development. The home page contains pseudo articles, that'll contain information
about the recent programs I've completed. It also contains an API call for the temp in a local area, displayed by searching by city. The form
for the site has Regex validation behind the inputs. This is to ensute that user inputs are cleaned before they are submitted to the backend.
Once the information is validated, the data is stored in local storage and used to populate the confirmation page that is displayed. The contact
page contains my contact info.
Capstone requirements: Regex form validation, Api call, storage of user inputs and display them in useful manner
